When you're coding in `vscode`, you may forget the spelling of an english word! It's take time to check the correct spelling and then return to the vscode and continue coding. So, this extension enables you to correct most mistakes.

When you doubt spelling a word, you can simply highlight that word and then press `ctrl + shift + p` and type `Which Word?`. The extension returns you the words that sound like your word. When several corrections are possible, you can see a list of corrections and select one of them.

This extension, use [`datamuse API`](https://www.datamuse.com/api/).
